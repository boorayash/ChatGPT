# ChatGPT
Welcome to the frontend repository for our Chatbot Application!

This repository contains the frontend code for a Chatbot application that is similar to ChatGPT, and is built using HTML and CSS. The application allows users to interact with a chatbot interface, but does not have the ability to provide responses or perform any actions.

The frontend code is built using standard web technologies such as HTML and CSS, and includes a range of elements and styles to create an engaging and user-friendly experience. Some of the key features of the Chatbot frontend include:

A clean and intuitive user interface that allows users to easily interact with the chatbot.

Support for a range of user inputs, including text, voice, and images.

Customizable settings and preferences to personalize the chatbot experience.

Please note that this is a frontend-only repository and does not include any backend code or functionality. You can use this repository as a starting point for building your own Chatbot application or integrate it into an existing project.

To get started with the Chatbot frontend, simply clone this repository and open the index.html file in a web browser. We hope you find this code to be a useful resource for your projects and applications!
